# Exact Arrow Entry

This code is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 4 that calculates and displays moving averages and a signal line on a chart. It also generates buy or sell signals based on the crossing of the fast and slow moving averages.

## Indicator Parameters

- `fastPeriod`: The period for the fast moving average. Default value is 12.
- `slowPeriod`: The period for the slow moving average. Default value is 26.
- `signalPeriod`: The period for the signal line. Default value is 9.

## Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called when the indicator is initialized. It sets the indicator buffers and labels for the moving averages and signal line.

## Indicator Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is called on each new tick or bar. It calculates the moving averages using the `iMA()` function and stores the values in the `fastMA` and `slowMA` arrays. It then calculates the signal line using the `iMAOnArray()` function and stores the values in the `signalLine` array.

## Trading Logic

The code includes a simple trading logic based on the crossing of the fast and slow moving averages. If the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average, a buy signal is generated. If the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average, a sell signal is generated. If there is no crossing, no signal is generated.
